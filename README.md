## Description

The `olog` package provides an ergonomic frontend API for OpenTelemetry structured logging.

It is designed to provide a more user-friendly interface while using the OpenTelemetry Logs API as the backend.

It addresses the concerns raised in
[opentelemetry-specification#4661](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/4661).

### Features

1. **Simple API**: Easy-to-use methods like `Debug()`, `Info()`, `Warn()`, `Error()` similar to popular logging libraries
2. **Event logging**: Level-specific event methods (`TraceEvent()`, `DebugEvent()`, `InfoEvent()`, `WarnEvent()`, `ErrorEvent()`) and their attribute counterparts
3. **Structured logging**: Support for key-value pairs using the alternating syntax (similar to `slog`)
4. **Level-specific enabled checks**: Level-specific enabled checks (`DebugEnabled()`, `InfoEventEnabled()`, etc.) to avoid expensive operations.
5. **Context support**: All methods accept `context.Context` for trace correlation
6. **Logger composition**: `With()` and `WithAttr()` methods for attribute composition
7. **Automatic package detection**: Auto-detects caller's package name when logger name is not specified
8. **Type safety**: Support for both argument-based and strongly-typed attribute APIs

This module follows several key design principles:

1. **Ergonomic API**: Provides simple methods that are easy to use and understand
2. **Performance First**: Includes `Enabled()` checks and optimizations to minimize overhead
3. **Structured Logging**: Emphasizes key-value pairs over string formatting
4. **Compatibility**: Uses OpenTelemetry Logs API as the backend for full compatibility
5. **Composability**: Supports logger composition through `With()`
6. **Familiar Patterns**: Similar to `slog` design patterns that Go developers already know
